Select the season and date that a match was played.
Complete the CASE statement so that only Bologna's home and away wins are identified.

```sql
-- Select the season and date columns
SELECT 
	season,
	date,
    -- Identify when Bologna won a match
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 
        AND home_goal > away_goal 
        THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857
        AND away_goal > home_goal 
        THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END AS outcome
FROM matches_italy;
```

Select the home_goal and away_goal for each match.

Use the CASE statement in the WHERE clause to filter all NULL values generated by the statement in the previous step.

```sql
-- Select the season, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns
SELECT 
	season,
    date,
	home_goal,
    away_goal
FROM matches_italy
WHERE 
-- Exclude games not won by Bologna
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END IS NOT NULL;
```

```sql
```
