## Add a subquery to the SELECT clause

```sql
SELECT 
	l.name AS league,
    -- Select and round the league's total goals
    ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal), 2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Select & round the average total goals for the season
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(home_goal + away_goal), 2) 
     FROM match
     WHERE season = '2013/2014') AS overall_avg
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Filter for the 2013/2014 season
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY league;
```

## Subqueries in Select for Calculations
Select the average goals scored in a match for each league in the main query.
Select the average goals scored in a match overall for the 2013/2014 season in the subquery.
Subtract the subquery from the average number of goals calculated for each league.
Filter the main query so that only games from the 2013/2014 season are included.

```sql
SELECT
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal),2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Subtract the overall average from the league average
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) - 
		(SELECT avg(home_goal + away_goal)
		 FROM match 
         WHERE season = '2013/2014'),2) AS diff
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Only include 2013/2014 results
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY l.name;
```
