In chapter 2, you generated a list of countries and the number of matches in each country with more than 10 total goals. The query in that exercise utilized a subquery in the FROM statement in order to filter the matches before counting them in the main query.
You can list one (or more) subqueries as common table expressions (CTEs) by declaring them ahead of your main query, which is an excellent tool for organizing information and placing it in a logical order.

In this exercise, let's rewrite a similar query using a CTE.

```sql
-- Set up your CTE
WITH match_list as (
    SELECT 
  		country_id, 
  		id
    FROM match
    WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10)
-- Select league and count of matches from the CTE
SELECT
    l.name AS league,
    COUNT(match_list.id) AS matches
FROM league AS l
-- Join the CTE to the league table
LEFT JOIN match_list ON l.id = match_list.country_id
GROUP BY l.name;
```
## Organizing with CTEs

This time, let's expand on the exercise by looking at details about matches with very high scores using CTEs. Just like a subquery in FROM, you can join tables inside a CTE.
Declare your CTE, where you create a list of all matches with the league name.
Select the league, date, home, and away goals from the CTE.
Filter the main query for matches with 10 or more goals.

```sql
-- Set up your CTE
with match_list as (
  -- Select the league, date, home, and away goals
    SELECT 
  		l.name AS league, 
     	date, 
  		m.home_goal, 
  		m.away_goal,
       (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN league as l ON m.country_id = l.id)
-- Select the league, date, home, and away goals from the CTE
SELECT league, date, home_goal, away_goal
FROM match_list
-- Filter by total goals
WHERE total_goals >= 10;
```

## CTEs with nested subqueries

```sql
-- Set up your CTE
WITH match_list AS (
    SELECT 
  		country_id,
  	   (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals
    FROM match
  	-- Create a list of match IDs to filter data in the CTE
    WHERE id IN (
       SELECT id
       FROM match
       WHERE season = '2013/2014' AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 08))
-- Select the league name and average of goals in the CTE
SELECT 
	l.name,
    avg(match_list.goals)
FROM league AS l
-- Join the CTE onto the league table
LEFT JOIN match_list ON l.id = match_list.country_id
GROUP BY l.name;
```
